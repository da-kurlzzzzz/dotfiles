# dotfiles
These are just simple dotfiles for my Arch Linux installation.  They *should*
work on other distros, but your mileage may wary.  I only use zsh plugins so
vim and tmux configs are kind of purist.  For zsh my plugins are
`grml-zsh-config`, `zsh-vi-mode` and `command-not-found` from `pkgfile`
